# passwordGenerator
this code's goal is to creat a different password everytime it's run by walking you through series of prompts and confirmations. The first prompt asks you to select from a range of 8 -128 but prompt returns a string datatype. I couldn't figure out a way to convert it to a number as a result I couldn't make an if statement such that it would prevent the user from inputting anything outside of that range. Once the all the prompts are complete the password should be displayed in the page. The html and css were already written as given by the assignment. I just wrote the javascript.
